TODO

- Need elevator pitch / message I want to deliver, why I want audience
to see the talk and what I want them to get out of it

"X is hard/fun/easy/cool"
"How to do X by using technique Y"
e.g. "Anyone can become a good speaker by learning these ten steps"
then drive the content writing from this statement

Tell a story
- throw out everything you have, organize into coherent story
- use some story types to help:
  catalog (list of details)
  end to end (start to finish ("Ansible in 30 minutes", beginner to
    advanced, simple to complex, linear organization)
  quest (problem, then solution and how you got there, post-mortem)
  enlightenment (journel from ignorance to knowledge, used to do X,
    learned Y, now do Z)
  show and tell (start with a bang, demo of complex or difficult, then
    examine and explain how it worked)
  theme and variations (show different alternatives for doing something)

Story types for my talk:
  - show and tell
  - quest?

- bonus material section (more detail etc.) if no questions or more time
